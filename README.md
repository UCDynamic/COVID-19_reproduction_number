This repository contains the Matlab scripts designed for simulating and analyzing COVID-19 dynamics within Hamilton County, Ohio, USA, utilizing the corresponding dataset. 
To execute PDE predictions, run the 'single_run.m' file. 
The 'Reproduction_number.m' file computes the reproduction number for Hamilton County throughout the simulation period. 
For visual comparison between the model-simulated reproduction number and estimates derived from the Wallinga-Teunis method, execute the 'Reproduction_number_plotting.m' file.
